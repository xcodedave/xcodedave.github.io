title: Hello World.

Ahh, the obligatory 'hello world' first post on this blog. I'm still configuring this to get it exactly how I want, but [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) has proven very easy to work with. 

Something I intend to experiment with shortly is to embed canvas elements/webgl into my posts, but that'll take some figuring out... :)
